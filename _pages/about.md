Hello,

I'm Chen, currently working as an ISP algorithm engineer at [Axera Japan](https://www.axera-tech.com/). My primary research interests encompass computational imaging/photography, optics, AI, ISP, and their related areas and applications.

I earned my B.Eng in 2018 from the [University of Electronics Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Subsequently, I pursued my education in Japan at the Department of Information and Communications Engineering, [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), under the guidance of [Professor Masahiro Yamaguchi](https://www.oid.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/wp/home_en/). I successfully obtained my M.Eng in 2020 and completed my D.Eng in 2023 from Tokyo Tech, with my doctoral research focusing on computational imaging, particularly lensless camera and see-through screen camera.

I welcome connections and conversations at uestccx@hotmail.com, not only for research discussions but also for potential job opportunities.
